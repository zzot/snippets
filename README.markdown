Junk Drawer
===========

This is my personal code junk-drawer.  The only rule here is that someday,
possibly in ancient times, I thought a bit of code might be useful later,
and was tired of it laying around as an independent file in my Downloads
folder, on my Desktop, or in a browser tab or something.

Snippets are generally organized by language, or at least I expect they will
be organized by language when I chase down some of the stray files I have
littering my machine and put them in here.
