{"name":"Snippets","tagline":"Personal code junk drawer.","body":"Junk Drawer\r\n===========\r\n\r\nThis is an extended README with some extra junk thrown in while I play with the Pages generator.  YMMV.\r\n\r\n### Introduction\r\n\r\nThis is my personal code junk drawer.  The only rule here is that someday,\r\npossibly in ancient times, I thought a bit of code might be useful later,\r\nand was tired of it laying around as an independent file in my Downloads\r\nfolder, on my Desktop, or in a browser tab or something.\r\n\r\nSnippets are generally organized by language, or at least I expect they will\r\nbe organized by language when I chase down some of the stray files I have\r\nlittering my machine and put them in here.\r\n\r\n### Uselessness\r\n\r\nSince I haven't touched this in five years, the few snippets that I've added are all (I think) out of date. For example, this is a workaround for a problem that no longer exists:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\r\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\r\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\r\n<dict>\r\n    <key>get-task-allow</key>\r\n    <false/>\r\n</dict>\r\n</plist>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I added this, Xcode set the `get-task-allow` entitlement to `true` under certain circumstances for Ad-Hoc distribution builds.  Since Ad-Hoc provisioning profiles require this entitlement to be `false`, the resulting app was invalid.  Apple has long since updated Xcode to not create this situation in the first place.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects.
